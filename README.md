# About this Repository

We want to provide a smooth, crypto-focused & non-political social-media experience, even while browsing content on the Hive blockchain. The blockchain is always censorship resistant, but every interface/website has to decide which content to show.
In our case, we use this transparent and public viewable `list.json`.

If an account is in a group within `list.json`, it's due to the following reasons:


## Explanation

- `automated`: We don't show automated comments.
- `political`: We don't show political/highly controversial content/accounts.
- `banned`: Accounts who infringed against our ToS or Community Guidelines.



---

**Important:** Please refrain from asking us to remove accounts from this list. Remember: The content/account is still accessible via the Hive blockchain and possibly also via other Hive interfaces if it's not blocked there as well - inji is simply not the place for such content. Thank you!
